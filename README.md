# ryry's dti preset faces.

## custom makeup faces made by me, growing with updates frequently. (custom makeup NOT NEEDED!)

REQUIREMENTS:
- A roblox script executor.
- Custom Makeup in Dress To Impress if you want to save any faces for later, when not using the gui. (gamepass not needed for equipping faces via gui.)

# gui script:

``` lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryleyw8412/dti-preset-faces/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
```
# WARNING: Roblox is rolling out an anti cheat update slowly, meaning if you are detected with a modified version of roblox to work with your executor, you will get punishments, leading up to termination. BE SAFE!
